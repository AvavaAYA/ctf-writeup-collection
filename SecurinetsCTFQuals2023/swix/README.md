Unintended for pwn - swix
When doing the forensic - The Betrayers we found some custom docker image of the account medrafk8s
If you go on https://hub.docker.com/r/medrafk8s, there is https://hub.docker.com/r/medrafk8s/pwn-swix
Which you can just extract the flag.txt from the docker

Sorry for this mistake: Just to clarify, Swix Challenge is an old challenge hosted in Local Tunisian CTF (MINI CTF last edition). 6 Months ago, I picked a random Pwn Chall from MINI CTF Repository to do some test. And I didn't notice that the same challenge was re-published again!
