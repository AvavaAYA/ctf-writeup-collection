RealESXi

This task is about a real ESXi sandbox escape. Suppose you already can execute arbitrary code in vmx, but you are still tied to the sandbox, escape from the sandbox and capture the flag (/var/run/vmware-hostd-ticket/flag).

There are two ports open for you: the ssh port and the server.py bound port. Use client.py to send your exp.
You have two known weapons: CVE-2021-22042 and CVE-2021-22043.

Local test method: install ESXi and run "python server.py" on it.

The ESXi has a long start-up time, please connect 5 minutes after the gambox start.

Many thanks to Moesang for his help in building the task environment. Server.py and client.py are partially borrowed from ESXisbx in Qiangwang Cup S5.
