# Wall Maria

## Instruction

- You have a busybox shell running as root
- The Qemu running this VM is built with a custom, vulnerable PCI device called `maria`
- Try exploiting the `maria` PCI device to achieve Qemu escape
- You may assumed that Busybox, the Linux kernel, and other parts of Qemu are **not vulnerable**.

## Files

- `./share/qemu-system-x86_64`: The vulnerable Qemu binary
- `./src/maria.c`: The source code of the custom PCI device

## Flag location

- `/home/user/flag` (The flag is located outside the virtual machine)

## Notes

- **Your exploit should be library-agnostic. In other words, it should not rely on shared library offsets.**
