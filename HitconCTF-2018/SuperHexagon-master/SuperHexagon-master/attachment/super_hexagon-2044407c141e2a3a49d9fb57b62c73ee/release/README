1.  Flags have to be read from 8 sysregs: s3_3_c15_c12_0 ~ s3_3_c15_c12_7
    For example, in aarch64, you may use:

            mrs x0, s3_3_c15_c12_0
            mrs x1, s3_3_c15_c12_1
                             .
                             .
                             .
            mrs x7, s3_3_c15_c12_7

    For first two stages, EL0 and EL1, `print_flag' functions are included.
    Make good use of them.

    qemu-system-aarch64, based on qemu-3.0.0, is also patched to support this
    feature. See `qemu.patch' for more details.



2.  You may add `-S -s' to qemu-system-aarch64 and debug with gdb-multiarch.
    However, if you want to debug ARM binary, you have to patch QEMU, since it
    always give AArch64 debug information. See `qemu-arm-debug.patch'.

    Besides, latest gdb 8.2 may be less buggy.
